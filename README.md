# YouTube Clone Frontend

This is the frontend for the YouTube Clone project. It is built using React. 

This is not trying to work like YouTube in any way. It is my own version of YouTube.

## NOTE
This project needs a `.env` file in its root directory to work!
```env
VITE_API_ROOT=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api
VITE_AUTH_ROOT=http://localhost:3000/auth
```
